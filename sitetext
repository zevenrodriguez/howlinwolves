Food for thought Truck

The Food for Thought Truck was a project a team of ESI Design made for Parking Day. The food truck served as a kiosk for people to come and exchange their ideas as currency. People would walk up to the truck choose a topic like, a local secret or pick up line, contribute one, and in exchange you were given one in return.


Come Out and Play: Family Field Day was a special out reach project initiated by ESI Design and took place on Governors Island. Come Out and Play is a games festival geared for adults, where participants create games and invite the public to play them. The Field Day was geared towards kids.  I was in charge of physical design and helped with the coordination. Our goal was to create a time portal to 4 different times. Each portal served as a gate to another game. Kids were handed passports and were given beads as currency for Justin Time's Time Travel Agency.
